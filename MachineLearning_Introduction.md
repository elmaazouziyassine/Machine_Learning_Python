# Introduction to Machine Learning
- Grew out of work in AI
- New capability for computers 

Examples:
- Database mining
- Applications can't program by hand : handwriting recognition, most of NAtural Lanuage Processing (NLP)
- Self customizing programs : Amazon, Neflix product recommendations
- Understanding human learning (brain, real AI)

### What is Machine Learning
##### Definition 
Arthur Samuel (1959) : Machine Learning is the field of study that ives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Tom Mitchell (1998) : Well-posed Learning Problem ; 
"A computer program is said to learn from experience 3 with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Suppose your email program watches which emails you do or do not mark as spam, and based on that learns how to better filter spam.
What is the task T in this setting ? 
- Classifying emails as spam or not spam. --> T
- Watching you label emails as spam or not spam. --> E
- The number (or fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam. --> P
- None of the above - this is not a machine learning problem.

### Machine Learning Algorithms 
- Supervised Learning 
- Unsupervised Learning
- Others : Reinforcement Learning, Recommender systems

##### Supervised Learning 
Housing Price Prediction 
prise = f(size in m2)
- Supervised learning : "right answers" given
- **Regression** : Predict continuous values output (price)

Breast Cancer (malignant or benign based on tumorSize)
- **Classification** : Discrete valued output (0 or 1)

Quizes
Problem 1: You have a large iventory of identical items. You want to predict how many of these items will sell over the next 3 months.
Problem 2: You'd like software to examine individual customer accounts, and for each account decide if it has been hacked/compromised

Should you treat these as classification or as regression problems ?
- Both as classfication problems
- Both as regreession problmes 
- Problem 1 as a classification problem & Problem 2 as a regression problem 
- Problem 2 as a classification problem & Problem 1 as a regression problem
